Sentiment Analysis on TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews
This project aims to classify the sentiment of TripAdvisor hotel reviews as positive or negative using advanced text preprocessing techniques and a Na誰ve Bayes classifier. The dataset consists of 20,491 hotel reviews, and the final model achieved an accuracy of 94.96%.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to implement sentiment analysis on hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and classification.

Key Features
Dataset Size: 20,491 hotel reviews
Classification: Binary sentiment classification (positive/negative)
Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Removed noise (punctuation, special characters) and standardized text.
Stopwords Removal: Filtered out common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
Lemmatization: Converted words to their base form for better analysis.
Vectorization: Transformed text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
2. Sentiment Classification
Na誰ve Bayes Algorithm: Applied a Na誰ve Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis due to its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Model Optimization: Tuned parameters to enhance model performance.
3. Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Achieved a high test accuracy of 94.96% on unseen data.
Confusion Matrix: Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix to measure precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
Final Model Accuracy: 94.96%
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to assess model performance.
Dependencies
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk (for text preprocessing)
matplotlib (for visualizations)

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, achieving strong accuracy and interpretability for classifying TripAdvisor hotel reviews. The Na誰ve Bayes classifier, along with effective text preprocessing, resulted in a robust model capable of identifying sentiment with high accuracy.
